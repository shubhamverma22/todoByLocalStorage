                                    ToDo App Using LocalStorage
->In this Project we're Gonna Learn How to Save the data in LocalStorage using the type of Hook which is useEffect().
In Previous Days When there is no Concept of useEffect was Introduced we used InBild class 
band Functions:- componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount()
Here we create 2 components TodoForm.js and Todos.js

->By using useEffect you tell React that your Component needs to do something after Render
useEffect basically tells the App that "Hey before eve you load yourself up you might have to load some data".

->The most advantage of using useEffect is Your Application is Ridiculosly Fast. and It can be use Multiple Times.

->Here we use Some dependencies:- 
                    1. reactstrap
                    2. uuid  (to give unique id to every single todo)
                    3. bootstrap
                    4. react-icons

Note:- when we save the some Information of data in LocalStorage then on reloading the webpage the information is not gone it
save for us 


In Backend The todo is filled up with @ values 1.The values which you were written 2. the unique id's which is automatically alloted to todos


*Info- the value of Input is comming up from state

Q. Why we use preventDefault() ? in this Project
Ans. It's just becoz of onSubmit Event. When onSubmit event is fire than there is inbuild
function calls which actually reload the whole page on Contrary the whole details which were
filled by us is cleared. So to prevent the Default function call we use preventDefault()

Q. What We use For Putting-up/Retrevering anything to/from the storage?
Ans. We're using LocalStorage.getitem() and LocalStorage.setItem()

Q. What does filter method?
Ans. It creates the Entire new List
